-                    <p>I have recently graduated with a Diploma in Web based Design & Development from TAFE Ultimo. The studies at TAFE provided me with the knowledge and experience of developing web applications in Asp.NET MVC using C# and Sql server database.</p>
-                    <p>Since graduation, only a month ago, I have supplemented my knowledge in software development by exploring new technologies. I have been able to experiment and get hands on experience with Angular js, gulp task runner, creating css files using LESS and developing MVC Web API. I have deployed my first, very basic, Web API on Azure. In order to version my code, I am using TFS as my source control.</p>
-                    <p>Working with web technologies I have also gained the knowledge of tools like chrome web-development and fiddler which are essential for debugging.</p>
-                    <p>I also have experience creating wireframes for websites using Microsoft Visio.</p>
